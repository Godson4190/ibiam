                <p>In continuing our promise towards investors in assuring their trading is conducted with confidence
                  BLUEGATE FINANCIAL SERVICES promotes fully transparent trading policy to its stakeholders and investors.
                  We give you all the required trading information you need, including good rates, spreads and leverage, and
                  other benefits of being an investor under our platform. All provided to ensure a safe and comfortable
                  trading experience.</p>
                <p>
                  In the simplest form, BLUEGATE platform is a form of speculative futures trading, whereby the payoff is
                  either a pre-agreed amount or nothing at all. This total dual outcome is the reason the term "trading" is
                  used. trading Options can be applied to a broad number of assets, including commodities, stocks, indices
                  and even currency pairs. The main prerequisite required by these assets is that their values fluctuate
                  constantly throughout each trading day. This is important as you never actually buy an asset when you
                  purchase a trading option; you are simply making a speculative investment on an assets behavior over a set
                  period of time. trading options have gained much popularity in recent years, due to their simple up/down
                  nature, the low cost required to participate and the increased return on investment profits (ROI).
    
                </p>

                    in pairs, which means that you speculate on the price of the base currency rising or falling

                    Cryptocurrency and the quote currency is a fiat currency (e.g LTC/USD). If your prediction is
                    correct, you make a profit, which is the difference between your order's opening and closing price.

              </div>
              <p>CFD or Contract for Difference trading requires you to predict the rise or fall of various market; Forex,
                commodities, stocks and indices. You don't actually purchase the assets, instead you enter a contract
                between you and the broker. Let's say you want to trade on the outcome of the UK FTSE 100 and you expect it
                to rise. You enter the contract at the current price of the FTSE 100 and then when you are ready to exit the
                difference in price (the spread) is what you get paid on.</p>
              <p>You can buy multiple contracts which then multiplies the spread by the number of contracts you buy. This is
                your profit.
              </p>
              <p>In order to maximize you return on Investment (ROI) profit, you need to ensure that you are trading on a
                reliable platform with a good trading company. There is much to consider when choosing a trading

        How does Forex trading work?
What is Forex?
Forex is a speculation-based market that's traded in pairs. When you trade Forex, you buy or sell one currency against the other without physically owning them.
For example, if you believed that the price of EUR will rise against the USD, you'd
place a BUY order. If you thought that the price of EUR will fall, you'd place a SELL order. If your prediction was correct, you'd make a profit, which would be equal to the difference between the open and the close price.

Reduced Forex trading costs with TopFX
While the difference between the open and close price is your gross profit, you would also have to include your trading costs in the equation. The most essential trading cost is the spread and depending on the account type you choose, you may also be charged commissions.

TopFX offers ultra-low pricing on all our accounts, therefore choosing an account type is a matter of personal preference. Our RAW account type enables you to trade with spreads starting from 0.0 pips and some of the lowest commissions in the market while our ZERO account type features all-inclusive spreads and no commissions at all.
